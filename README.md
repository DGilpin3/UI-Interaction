# Week 4 Lab: UI Interactions & Animations 🌐✨

## 📖 Scenario/Summary
This week we practice what we learned in the lesson about **UI interactions** and how to animate them.  
You will:
- Begin with styling and animating links found in the body of text.  
- Create a **slide-in navigation menu** for improved usability.  
- Apply **scroll-based transitions** often seen in modern one-page websites.  

A starting HTML file and an `images` folder containing a logo image are provided. You will modify these files and use your creativity to make the page even better. Have fun!

📝 Notes
Animations use CSS keyframes and transitions for smooth effects.

JavaScript event listeners are used for menu interactions.

Scroll effects demonstrate modern UI practices for single-page websites.

Creativity is encouraged—experiment with colors, timing functions, and additional transitions!
